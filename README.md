Taipan is a Tool for Annotating Images in Preparation for ANalysis.

The Taipan package creates simple shiny surveys. The web applications
can be used locally or deployed and allow people to save survey results
as tidy data that is ready to use for analysis.

The app was initially created to streamline the process of manually
tagging images to create a training set. It allows users to provide
information regarding entire images, and smaller regions within. It is a
survey style tool, with questions being posed for each image and area
identified.
